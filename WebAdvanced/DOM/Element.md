[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)

The Element interface represents an object of a *Document*. 
This interface describes methods and properties common to all kinds of elements. 
Specific behaviors are described in interfaces which inherit from Element but add additional functionality.
 For example, the *HTMLElement* interface is the base interface for HTML elements, while the [SVGElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElement)
 interface is the basis for all SVG elements.
Languages outside the realm of the Web platform, like XUL through the XULElement interface, also implement it.
