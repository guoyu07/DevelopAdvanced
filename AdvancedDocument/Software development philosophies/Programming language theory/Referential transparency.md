[Referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency)

> 一个函数可以用它的值替代，没有负作用，例如查询操作，可以简化编程。

**Referential transparency** and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.[1] 
As a result, evaluating a referentially transparent function gives the same value for same arguments. 
Such functions are called pure functions. An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.
