[Bleeding edge technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology)

Bleeding edge technology is a category of technologies so new that they could have a high risk of being unreliable and lead adopters to incur greater expense in order to make use of them.

## Criteria

A technology may be considered bleeding edge where it contains a degree of risk, or, more generally, there is a significant downside to early adoption, such as:

* Lack of consensus – competing ways of doing new things exist and there is little to no indication in which direction the market will go.[citation needed] By its very nature, consumers and firms will be unfamiliar with the product and its relationship to existing technologies,[2] leading to rapid changes in what is considered best practice as more becomes known about the technology's qualities.[3]
* Lack of testing – The technology may be unreliable,[2] or simply untested.[3]
* Industry resistance to change – trade journals and industry leaders have spoken against a new technology or product but some organizations are trying to implement it anyway because they are convinced it is technically superior.[citation
