[Boat anchor (metaphor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_anchor_(metaphor))

In amateur radio and computing, a boat anchor or boatanchor is something obsolete, useless, and cumbersome â€“ so-called because metaphorically its only productive use is to be thrown into the water as a boat mooring. Terms such as brick, doorstop and paperweight are similar.
