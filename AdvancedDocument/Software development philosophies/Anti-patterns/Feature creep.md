[Feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)

Feature creep, creeping featurism or featuritis is the ongoing expansion or addition of new features in a product, such as in computer software.[1] These extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication rather than simple design.
