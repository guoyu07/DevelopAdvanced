[Cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)

Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, deep magic).[1] The term cargo cult programmer may apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer (or one inexperienced with the problem at hand) copies some program code from one place to another with little or no understanding of how it works or whether it is required in its new position.

Cargo cult programming can also refer to the results of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle. Examples are adding unnecessary comments to self-explanatory code, overzealous adherence to the conventions of a specific programming paradigm, or adding deletion code for objects that garbage collection would have collected automatically.

货物崇拜 （英文：Cargo Cults，又译货物运动）是一种宗教形式，尤其出现于一些与世隔绝的落后土著之中。当货物崇拜者看见外来的先进科技物品，便会将之当作神祇般崇拜。
