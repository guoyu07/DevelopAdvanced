[Law of the instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)


The concept known as the law of the instrument, Maslow's hammer (or gavel), or a golden hammer[a] is an over-reliance on a familiar tool; as Abraham Maslow said in 1966, "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."[1]
