[Big ball of mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud)

A big ball of mud is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. They are a type of design anti-pattern.
