[Second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect)

The second-system effect (also known as second-system syndrome) is the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to be plagued with feature creep due to inflated expectations.[1]

The phrase was first used by Fred Brooks in his book The Mythical Man-Month.[2] It described the jump from a set of simple operating systems on the IBM 700/7000 series to OS/360 on the 360 series.
