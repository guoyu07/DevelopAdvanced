[Anemic domain model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model)

Anemic domain model is the use of a software domain model where the domain objects contain little or no business logic (validations, calculations, business rules etc.).

This pattern was first described[1] by Martin Fowler, who considers the practice an anti-pattern. He says:

> The fundamental horror of this anti-pattern is that it's so contrary to the basic idea of object-oriented designing; which is to combine data and process them together. The anemic domain model is just a procedural style design, exactly the kind of thing that object bigots like me ... have been fighting since our early days in Smalltalk. What's worse, many people think that anemic objects are real objects, and thus completely miss the point of what object-oriented design is all about.
