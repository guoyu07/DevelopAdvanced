[Blind faith (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_faith_(computer_programming))

In computer programming, blind faith (also known as blind programming, blind coding, God-oriented programming, or divine orientation) is the name for a situation in which a programmer develops a solution or fixes a computer bug and deploys the creation without testing it. The programmer in this situation has blind faith in his or her own abilities.

Blind faith programming is usually considered an anti-pattern; the recommended[by whom?] alternative is test-driven development. However, it can also be used as a challenge to test a programmer's skills.
