[Brooks's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)

Brooks's law is a claim about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later".[1][2] It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month. According to Brooks, there is an incremental person who, when added to a project, makes it take more, not less time.
