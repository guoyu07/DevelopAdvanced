[Smoke and mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_and_mirrors)

In the field of computer programming, it is used to describe a program or functionality that does not yet exist, but appears as though it does. This is often done to demonstrate what a resulting project will function/look like after the code is complete â€” at a trade show, for example.
