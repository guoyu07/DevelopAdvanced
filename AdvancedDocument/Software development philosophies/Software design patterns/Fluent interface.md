[Fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)

In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is an implementation of an object oriented API that aims to provide more readable code.

A fluent interface is normally implemented by using method cascading (concretely method chaining) to relay the instruction context of a subsequent call (but a fluent interface entails more than just method chaining [1]). Generally, the context is

* defined through the return value of a called method
* self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last context
* terminated through the return of a void context.
