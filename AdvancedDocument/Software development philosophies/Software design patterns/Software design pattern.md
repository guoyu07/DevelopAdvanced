[Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.


## Documentation

The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution.[28] There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors. However, according to Martin Fowler, certain pattern forms have become more well-known than others, and consequently become common starting points for new pattern-writing efforts.[29] One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (collectively known as the "Gang of Four", or GoF for short) in their book Design Patterns. It contains the following sections:

* Pattern Name and Classification: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.
* Intent: A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.
* Also Known As: Other names for the pattern.
* Motivation (Forces): A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.
* Applicability: Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.
* Structure: A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.
* Participants: A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.
* Collaboration: A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.
* Consequences: A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
* Implementation: A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.
* Sample Code: An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.
* Known Uses: Examples of real usages of the pattern.
* Related Patterns: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.
