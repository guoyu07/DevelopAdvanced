[Module pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)

In software engineering, the module pattern is a design pattern used to implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming, in a programming language with incomplete direct support for the concept.

This pattern can be implemented in several ways depending on the host programming language, such as the singleton design pattern, object-oriented static members in a class and procedural global functions. In Python, the pattern is built into the language, and each .py file is automatically a module.
