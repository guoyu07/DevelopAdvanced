The basic principles are:

* Project is divided into sequential phases, with some overlap and splashback acceptable between phases.

* Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time.

* Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase. Written documentation is an explicit deliverable of each phase.
