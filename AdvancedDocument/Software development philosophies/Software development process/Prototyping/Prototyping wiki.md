[Prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Prototyping)

Software prototyping is about creating prototypes, i.e. incomplete versions of the software program being developed.

The basic principles are:


* Prototyping is not a standalone, complete development methodology, but rather an approach to try out particular features in the context of a full methodology (such as incremental, spiral, or rapid application development (RAD)).

* Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.

* The client is involved throughout the development process, which increases the likelihood of client acceptance of the final implementation.

* While some prototypes are developed with the expectation that they will be discarded, it is possible in some cases to evolve from prototype to working system.


A basic understanding of the fundamental business problem is necessary to avoid solving the wrong problems, but this is true for all software methodologies.
