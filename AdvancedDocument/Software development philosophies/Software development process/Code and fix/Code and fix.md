[Code and fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Code_and_fix)

"Code and fix" is an [anti-pattern](/wiki/Anti-pattern "Anti-pattern"). Development is not done through a deliberate strategy or methodology. It is often the result of schedule pressure on the [software development](/wiki/Software_development "Software development") team.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[[13]](#cite_note-13)</sup> Without much of a design in the way, [programmers](/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") immediately begin producing [code](/wiki/Source_code "Source code"). At some point, [testing](/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") begins (often late in the development cycle), and the unavoidable [bugs](/wiki/Computer_bug "Computer bug") must then be fixed - or at least, the most important ones must be fixed - before the product can be shipped.
