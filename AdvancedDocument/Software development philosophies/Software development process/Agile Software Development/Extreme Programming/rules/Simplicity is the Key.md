[Simplicity is the Key ](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html)

Within your project the team decides what is simple. Together you judge your code subjectively. 
I recommend four subjective qualities; Testable, Understandable, Browsable, and Explainable ([TUBE](http://www.zeespencer.com/judging-code-simplicity-fit-it-through-the-tube/)).
