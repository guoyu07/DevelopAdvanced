In object-oriented programming, the open/closed principle states *"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"*;[1] that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

The name open/closed principle has been used in two ways. Both ways use inheritance to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.
