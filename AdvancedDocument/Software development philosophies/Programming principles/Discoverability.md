[Discoverability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability)

Discoverability is the ability of something, especially a piece of content or information, to be found. Discoverability is a concern in library and information science, many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since a thing cannot be used if people cannot find it or don't understand what it's for. Metadata, or "information about information," such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine is an example of how to improve discoverability. Discoverability is related to, but different from, accessibility and usability, other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.

## Purpose

The usage of any piece of information directly relates to how discoverable it is. The quality of information depends upon the quality of the meta-information.

In the case of a service-oriented solution, because of the emphasis placed on service reusability, it stands very clear that opportunities should exist reuse, which is only possible if information is discoverable in the first place. To make services discoverable, the following set of activities need to be performed:

* Document the information about the service in a consistent manner.
* Store the documented information in a searchable repository.
* Enable others to search for the documented information in an efficient manner.

Apart from increasing the reuse potential of the services, discoverability is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service discoverability principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the service-oriented analysis phase of the service delivery process.
