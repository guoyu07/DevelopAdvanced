The principle of least astonishment (POLA) (alternatively "principle/law/rule of least astonishment/surprise")[1][2] applies to user interface and software design, from the ergonomics standpoint.[3]

A typical formulation of the principle is: "If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature."[4]

In general engineering design contexts, the principle can be taken to mean that a component of a system should behave in a manner consistent with how users of that component are likely to expect it to behave; that is, users should not be astonished at the way it behaves.
