[Is there a NuGet package for NUnit that includes the syntax helpers?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7688003/is-there-a-nuget-package-for-nunit-that-includes-the-syntax-helpers)


My understanding is that the NUnit Assert syntax helpers are in the NUnit.Framework assembly as of version 2.5. This assembly is included in the NUnit NuGet package.

Make sure you add `using NUnit.Framework;`

Anyway, if this isn't the answer you're looking for, perhaps you can clarify the question.

Hope this helps.
