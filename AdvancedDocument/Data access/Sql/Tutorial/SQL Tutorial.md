[SQL Tutorial](http://www.sqltutorial.org/)


SQL stands for structured query language designed to manipulate data in relational databases. Today, SQL is one of the most common programming languages for accessing data in the databases.

##Section 1: Introduction to SQL

* What is SQL – give you a brief overview of the SQL language and its popular dialects.
* SQL Syntax – provide you with the syntax of the SQL language.
* SQL Sample Database – introduce you to an HR sample database.

##Section 2: Querying Data

* SQL SELECT Statement – how to query data from a single table using the simplest form of the SELECT statement.
* Using SQL Aliases – make your query shorter and more understandable.
* SQL DISTINCT Operator – show you how to remove duplicates from the result set returned by the SELECT statement.
* SQL LIMIT – constrain a number of rows returned by a query using the LIMIT and OFFSET clause.

##Section 3: Filtering Data

* SQL WHERE Clause – filter data based on specified conditions using the WHERE clause.
* SQL AND operator – combine multiple Boolean expressions using the AND clause to create a flexible condition.
* SQL OR operator – show you how to use another logical operator OR to combine multiple Boolean expression t
* SQL BETWEEN Operator – guide you to use the BETWEEN operator to select data within a range of values.
* SQL IN Operator – show  you how to use the IN operator to check whether a value equals a list of values.
* SQL LIKE Operator –  do you want to query data based on a specific pattern? use the LIKE operator.
* SQL IS NULL Operator – introduce the NULL concepts and show you how to check whether an expression is NULL or not
* SQL NOT operator – show you how to negate a boolean expression using the NOT operator.
* Rules of Precedence

##Section 4: Sorting Data

* ORDER BY Clause – sort the data in ascending or descending order.

##Section 5: Conditional Expressions

* SQL CASE Expression – add logic to the SQL statements.

##Section 6: Aggregate Functions

* SQL AVG Function – calculate the average value of a set using the AVG function.
* SQL COUNT Function – return the number of rows in a set using the COUNT function.
* SUM Function – return the sum of a set using the SUM function
* SQL MAX Function – find the maximum value in a set using the MAX function.
* SQL MIN Function – find the minimum value in a set using the MIN function.

##Section 7: Grouping Data

* SQL GROUP BY clause – group row into groups and apply an aggregate function to each group.
* SQL HAVING Clause – filter groups summarized by the GROUP BY clause.

##Section 8: Joining Multiple Tables

* SQL INNER JOIN – introduce you to the join concept and show you how to use the INNER JOIN clause to query data from multiple tables.
* LEFT OUTER JOIN – provide you with another kind of joins that allows you to combine data from multiple tables.
* RIGHT OUTER JOIN
* FULL OUTER JOIN
* CROSS JOIN (Cartesian Product)
* SQL SELF JOIN – how to join a table to itself and when do you use it? welcome to the self-join tutorial.

##Section 9: Using SET Operators

* UNION and UNION ALL Operators – combine result set of two or more queries into a single result set using the UNION and UNION ALL operators.
* INTERSECT Operator  – show you how to get the intersection of two or more queries using the INTERSECT operator.
* MINUS Operator – shows you how to subtract a result set from another result set using the MINUS operator.

##Section 10: Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statements

* INSERT statement – insert one or more rows into a table
* UPDATE statement – modify data in a table
* DELETE statement – remove rows from a table
* COMMIT and ROLLBACK Statements


##Section 11: Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements

* SQL CREATE TABLE Statement – create a new table in the database using the CREATE TABLE statement.
* SQL ALTER TABLE Statement – modify the structure of an existing table with the ALTER TABLE statement.
* SQL DROP TABLE Statement – remove redundant tables permanently using the DROP TABLE statement.
* SQL TRUNCATE TABLE – remove all data in a big table fast and efficiently.
* RENAME Statement – change the name of a table with the RENAME table statement.


##Section 12: Creating Constraints


* PRIMARY KEY Constraint – show you how to define a primary key for a table
* FOREIGN KEY Constraint – walk you through the steps of enforcing the relationship between data in two tables using the foreign key.
* UNIQUE Constraint – allow you to ensure the uniqueness of values in a column or a set of column
* NOT NULL Constraint  – ensure that the values that being inserted or updated into a column are not NULL
* CHECK Constraint – validate the data before it is inserted or updated in one or more columns based on a Boolean expression.
