[How to open the Recycle Bin from the Windows command line?](http://superuser.com/questions/395015/how-to-open-the-recycle-bin-from-the-windows-command-line)

*Command line*

On the command line, type

```
start shell:RecycleBinFolder
```

It is not case sensitive, so you can just type start shell:recyclebinfolder.

*Run dialog*

An alternative is to use the Run dialog (menu Start/Run or Win + R) - there is less to type. Type

```
shell:RecycleBinFolder
```

and press OK (or hit Enter). 

*It is portable!*

This method works on all versions of Windows, at least back to Windows 2000.
