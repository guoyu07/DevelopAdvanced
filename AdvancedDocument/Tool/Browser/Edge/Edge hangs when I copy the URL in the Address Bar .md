[Edge hangs when I copy the URL in the Address Bar ](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-msedge/edge-hangs-when-i-copy-the-url-in-the-address-bar/6416d140-902a-4239-89bc-bd5e2b4ad5ed?page=6)

快被恶心死了！这个问题！

I found out that the same behavior is in the contact and calendar app. Guess that this all is an app sandbox (!) system problem not only an Edge bug.
If it is so it is a much bigger problem and therefore we have such an old bug.
Also Skype Preview hangs during both copy and paste. Latest update has reduced this behavior, but not eliminated it.
