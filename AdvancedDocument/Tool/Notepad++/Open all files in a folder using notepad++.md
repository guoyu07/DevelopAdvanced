[Open all files in a folder using notepad++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22286433/open-all-files-in-a-folder-using-notepad)

## answer


You can just simply drag the folder containing your site files into notepad++. It opens all files(I assume it just opens txt,html, and other compatible files) including ones in sub directories.

Alternatively, if you want to do them one month at a time you could do File>Open and then shift+click from the top to the bottom to select as many files as you want.

Or just use a better text editor like sublime text where you can just open entire folders
