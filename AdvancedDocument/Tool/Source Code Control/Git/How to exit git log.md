[How to exit git log?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9483757/how-to-exit-git-log)

按 ：q 可以退出


Actually, there are three ways to do it, precisely.

Type any of the following 3 commands.
1.:q
2.:z
 or
3.Ctrl + z.

P.S.: Sometimes, for someone, one of these options doesn't seem to work and for others it works.
