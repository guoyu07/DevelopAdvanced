One of the most powerful tools in writing maintainable code is
  break large methods into well-named smaller methods - a technique
  Kent Beck refers to as the Composed Method pattern.

What works for methods often works for other things as well. One
  area that I've run into a couple of times where people fail to do
  this is with regular expressions.

Let's say you have a file full of rules for scoring frequent
  sleeper points for a hotel chain. The rules all look rather like:

<pre>score 400 for 2 nights at Minas Tirith Airport
  </pre>

We need to pull out the points (400) the number of nights (2) and
  the hotel name (Minas Tirith Airport) for each of these rows.

This is an obvious task for a regex, and I'm sure right now
  you're thinking - oh yes we need:

<pre>const string pattern = 
  @"^score\s+(\d+)\s+for\s+(\d+)\s+nights?\s+at\s+(.*)";
</pre>

Then our three values just pop out of the groups.

I don't know whether or not you're comfortable in understanding
  how that regex works and whether it's correct. If you're like me you
  have to look at a regex like this and carefully figure out what it's
  saying. I often find myself counting parentheses so I can see where
  the groups line up (not actually that hard in this case, but I've
  seen plenty of others where it's tougher).

You may have read advice to take a pattern like this and to
  comment it. (Often needs a switch when you turn it into a regex.)
  That way you can write it like this.

<pre>    protected override string GetPattern() {
      const string pattern =
        @"^score
        \s+  
        (\d+)          # points
        \s+
        for
        \s+
        (\d+)          # number of nights
        \s+
        night
        s?             #optional plural
        \s+
        at
        \s+
        (.*)           # hotel name
        ";

      return pattern;
    }
  }
  </pre>

This is easier to follow, but comments never quite satisfy
  me. Occasionally I've been accused of saying comments are bad, and
  that you shouldn't use them. This is wrong, in both senses.
  Comments are not bad - but there are often better options. I always
  try to write code that doesn't need comments, usually by good
  naming and structure. (I can't always succeed, but I feel I do more
  often than not.)

People often don't try to structure regexs, but I find it
  useful. Here's one way of doing this one.

<pre>    const string scoreKeyword = @"^score\s+";
    const string numberOfPoints = @"(\d+)";
    const string forKeyword = @"\s+for\s+";
    const string numberOfNights = @"(\d+)";
    const string nightsAtKeyword = @"\s+nights?\s+at\s+";
    const string hotelName = @"(.*)";

    const string pattern =  scoreKeyword + numberOfPoints +
      forKeyword + numberOfNights + nightsAtKeyword + hotelName;
  </pre>

I've broken down the pattern into logical chunks and put them
  together again at the end. I can now look at that final expression
  and understand the basic chunks of the expression, diving into the
  regex for each one to see the details. 

Here another alternative that seeks to separate the whitespace to
  make the actual regexs look more like tokens.

<pre>    const string space = @"\s+";
    const string start = "^";
    const string numberOfPoints = @"(\d+)";
    const string numberOfNights = @"(\d+)";
    const string nightsAtKeyword = @"nights?\s+at";
    const string hotelName = @"(.*)";

    const string pattern =  start + "score" + space + numberOfPoints + space +
      "for" + space + numberOfNights + space + nightsAtKeyword + 
       space + hotelName;
  </pre>

I find this makes the individual tokens a bit clearer, but all
  those space variables makes the overall structure harder to
  follow. So I prefer the previous one.

But this does raise a question. All of the elements are separated
  by space, and putting in lots of space variables or `\s+`
  in the patterns feels wet. The nice thing about breaking out the
  regexs into sub-strings is that I can now use the programming logic
  to come up with abstractions that suit my particular purpose
  better. I can write a method that will take sub strings and join
  them up with whitespace.

<pre>    private String composePattern(params String[] arg) {
      return "^" + String.Join(@"\s+", arg);
    }
  </pre>

Using this method, I then have.

<pre>    const string numberOfPoints = @"(\d+)";
    const string numberOfNights = @"(\d+)";
    const string hotelName = @"(.*)";

    const string pattern =  composePattern("score", numberOfPoints, 
      "for", numberOfNights, "nights?", "at", hotelName);
  </pre>

You may not use exactly any of these alternative yourself, but I
  do urge you to think about how to make regular expressions
  clearer. Code should not need to be figured out, it should be just
  read.

## Updates

In this discussion I've made the elements for the composed
    regexs be local variables. A variation is to take commonly used
    regex elements and use them more widely. This can be handy to use
    common regexs that are needed in lots of places. My colleague
    Carlos Villela comments that one thing to watch out for is if
    these fragments are not well-formed, ie having an opening
    parenthesis that's closed in another fragment. This can be tricky
    to debug. I've not felt the need to do it, so haven't run into
    this problem.

A few people mentioned using fluent interfaces (internal DSLs)
    as an more readable [alternative
    to regexs](http://flimflan.com/blog/ReadableRegularExpressions.aspx). I see this as a separate thing. Regexs don't bother
    me if they are small, indeed I prefer a small regex to an
    equivalent fluent interface. It's the composition that counts,
    which you can do with either technique.

Some others mentioned named capture groups. Like comments, I
    find these are better than the raw regex, but still find a
    composed structure more readable. The point of composition is that
    it breaks the overall regex into small pieces that are easier to
    understand.
