One of two [SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude](SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html)s. 	The
directing attitude says that since most developers aren't that good
(it's rumored that almost 50% are below average) we need to direct the
way they do things. This direction is to prevent them from causing
harm to the system they are working on. Typically this attitude
manifests itself in designs and tools that prevent developers from
doing certain things, limiting what they can do to keep them away from
complex areas.

People with an [EnablingAttitude](EnablingAttitude.html) criticize this
whips-and-chains attitude  by saying you can't foolproof anything,
because fools are ingenious and will figure out how to abuse any
system.
